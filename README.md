This is a Python script that extracts information about apartments available for rent from Zillow.com, stores it in lists, and then submits the data to a Google Form. The script uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the HTML content of the Zillow website and extract relevant data such as the links, addresses, and prices of available apartments. It then uses the Selenium library to automate the process of filling out the Google Form with the collected data.

The script begins by importing the required libraries such as BeautifulSoup, requests, time, and Selenium. It then defines the URLs for the Zillow website and the Google Form. It sends an HTTP request to the Zillow website and uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the page. It then finds all the available apartments listed on the page and extracts their links, addresses, and prices. The collected data is stored in three separate lists.

Next, the script uses Selenium to automate the process of filling out the Google Form. It iterates through the list of links and for each link, it creates a new instance of the Chrome browser using Selenium. It then navigates to the Google Form URL and uses time.sleep to give the browser time to load the page. It then uses the find_element method of Selenium to locate the relevant input fields on the form and fills them out with the corresponding data from the lists.

Once all the data has been submitted to the form, the browser is closed and the process repeats for the next link in the list. The script outputs the lists of links, addresses, and prices to the console for debugging purposes.
